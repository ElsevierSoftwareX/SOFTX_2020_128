\section{Characterization} \label{sec:characterization}

In this section, the Omicron algorithm is characterized. To achive this, we consider Gaussian noise and, on top of it, we inject sinusoidal Gaussian burst signals with known characteristics. This is done using the injection feature of Omicron described in Sec.~\ref{sec:algorithm:injections}. The burst waveform is given in Eq.~\ref{eq:sginj}. Then, we estimate the accuracy with which Omicron recovers the signal parameters.
\begin{itemize}
\item The timing accuracy is estimateded with the absolute time difference, $\tau_o-\tau_b$, where $\tau_o$ is the time measured by Omicron (tile time) and $\tau_b$ is the time of the injection.
\item The frequency accuracy is estimated with the relative difference, $\phi_o-\phi_b$, where $\phi_o$ is the frequency measured by Omicron (tile frequency) and $\phi_b$ is the frequency of the injection.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{White noise} \label{sec:characterization:white}
As a first characterization, we simulate burst signals with $\phi_b$ taking random values between 32~Hz and 256~Hz, $Q_b$ between 4 and 64. The time of the injection is randomly drawn in $\pm10$~s around the chunk center. Signals are injected over a white noise data stream using a fix amplitude value such that the resulting SNR (computed with Eq.~\ref{eq:snr_white}) is 10. Then we run Omicron with the parameters listed in Appx~\ref{appx:parameters}. The maximal fractional energy loss between tile is varied around the nominal value of $\mu_{max}=20\%$. 


In the left-hand side of Fig.~\ref{}, the measured SNR is plotted against the true SNR. The plot in right-hand side of Fig.~\ref{} shows the relative SNR difference. This result is well compatible with what we obtained from Monte Carlo studies presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:snrestimator} and Tab.~\ref{tab:snrestimator}.

The signal amplitude is now fixed such that the true SNR (see Eq.\ref{eq:snr_white}) is 10 and we use fixed values for $Q_b$. 

\subsection{Colored noise} \label{sec:characterization:colored}

the amplitude spectral density of which is represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:noise_asd}. On top of this, sinusoidal Gaussian burst signals are injected. The signal expression is given by
