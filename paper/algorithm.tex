The input data time series are read using the frame library. The Omicron algorithm

  \caption{Data segmentation. The data are loaded by chunks and chunks are divided in blocks. The chunks have a duration $T$ and are used to estimate the power spectral density. The blocks have a duration $t$ and are analyzed sequentially. Chunks (and blocks) overlap with a duration $o$. This segmentation must therefore verify $T=n(t-o)+o$ where $n$ is an integer.}

\subsection{The power spectral density} \label{sec:algorithm:psd}
- PSD definition - PSD implementation (size, FT...).

To obtain a reliable PSD estimation, we use the procedure defined in~\cite{psd}.
The data chunk is divided into N segments overlapping by half, as represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:mmm}. The PSD of each segment is computed. This set of PSDs is divided into two groups corresponding to non-overlapping segments: the 'odd' (resp. 'even') group is defined with segments with an odd (resp. even) index.
